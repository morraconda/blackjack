cute simple blackjack program made using tkinter GUI

To start a new hand after the current one has ended, press a bet button. 
You cannot start a new hand while the current hand is still in progress.

Currently doesn't check for going below $0 money or have a win condition for going above a certain amount. 
Probably not too hard to implement but the base game works.

Using globals is clumsy but also seemed the easiest way to do things at first glance.
Grid is the wrong tkinter widget to use here and makes the spaced out buttons look quite bad, but oh well.
